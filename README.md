Cannon & Castle  

Project Overview  
This project combines ancient warfare aesthetics with modern engineering principles to design and build a **Cannonball Shooter** and a **Castle Structure**. It features a functional spring-based cannon mechanism and a meticulously crafted castle model, showcasing precision manufacturing processes and mechanical design. Our project was also announced as **Best Project for 2023-24(2)** for TA211 course. 

Features  
- Cannonball Shooter:  
  - Spring-powered firing mechanism for launching projectiles.  
  - Adjustable firing angles and 360-degree rotation for versatile aiming.  
- Castle Model:  
  - Custom-built with sheet metal, featuring windows, gates, and a bridge.  

Manufacturing Processes  
- Cutting, Drilling, Welding, Brazing: Used for various metal components.  
- Sheet Metal Forming: Applied for shaping body parts and containers.   

Materials  
- Galvanized Iron Sheets (2mm)  
- Aluminum (for Cannon)  
- Thin Galvanized Wire (for Spring)

Team  
A 10-member team contributed through task-specific roles, including design, shaping, welding, and assembly, ensuring the project was completed with precision and teamwork.

Acknowledgments  
We extend our gratitude to **Prof. Shashank Shekhar** and all lab staff and TAs for their invaluable guidance and support throughout the project.
